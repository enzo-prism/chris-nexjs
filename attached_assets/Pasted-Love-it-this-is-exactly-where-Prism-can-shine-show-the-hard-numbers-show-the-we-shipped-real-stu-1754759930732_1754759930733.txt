Love it—this is exactly where Prism can shine: show the hard numbers + show the “we shipped real stuff” story. Here’s an updated, client‑ready spec for Chris Wong DDS — July 2025 /analytics that maximizes perceived and real value.

Why this layout works
	•	Proof of impact (numbers) + proof of effort (highlights) = trust and retention.
	•	Reputation module ties reviews directly to conversion (and gives you a reason to ask for more).
	•	Targets make the client feel momentum and show you’re steering the ship.
	•	Standardized schema means updating the page each month is a drop‑in swap of latest.json.

If you want, I can also:
	•	add a small “Performance vs Prior Month” band (once we have June baselines),
	•	wire a reviews ingestor (CSV → count, themes via quick AI keywords),
	•	and drop in the React components (Recharts + simple tables) so this ships quickly on Replit/Lovable.
